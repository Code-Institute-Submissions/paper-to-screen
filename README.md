# **Data Centric Development**

## **Milestone Project**

### **Paper to Screen**
My third milestone project is entitled Paper to Screen. One of the Data Centric Development Milestone Project ideas was to Build a book review and recommendation site. With the intent to help external users find books they would like to read and support the site owner’s in earning money on each book purchased via a link from the site. The website includes a forum which allows users to upload details of books, including book name, author name, description and any other relevant fields such as star rating and whether they have read or watched or both. It also allows users to write comments about any book and upvote it. The Website follows the CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) to allow users to add new books and reviews to the site, edit them and delete them. Within the “Our Choices” page each book features an affiliate link to Amazon. Note this is not an actual affiliate link, but rather just a way to demonstrate how this could work. Instead, for this project, we encourage you to just keep the tag value as something fake. Also, note that in general it's better to link directly to the book's page in the store, but that's a bit more difficult.

#### **The business goals of this website are:**
* Build awareness of novels that have been adapted to the big screen.
* Provide information on the site owner’s top choices and a way of adding books for other people to purchase and read.
* Provide contact info to ensure all users are kept up to date. 
* Excellent UX to users on site long enough to obtain all information they would need.

#### **The customer goals of this website are:**
* Searching for popular books and films/series and where to buy them.
* Find contact information and social sites. 
* Clear and easy to find info on the sites owners. There top choices and what the website is about.

### **UX**
This website is aimed at existing fans and possible new ones. It advertises new and existing books and films/series, information on the site’s owners with their top recommendations and a clear way to contact them. (B2B) As a developer I wanted to create a colour scheme and picture aesthetic across all 4 pages to allow the website to flow, there would be no drastic changes and I ultimately wanted the user experience to be almost calming so it subconsciously gives Paper to Screen an aura of relaxation. (B2B & B2C) I also wanted the navigation system to be fairly simple so the user knows where the menu is sending them. Nothing ambiguous. I looked at many book recommendation websites and forums of what fans wanted. (B2C)
   
 
I started off by using Balsamiq to create my wireframes but then moved onto Publisher to create the other pages. This is mainly because I find the layout on Balsamiq easier to use however the colour and font elements on publisher opens more creative avenues.
I used the following steps with my UX.
#### UX Design Methods

##### Ethnographic Research
UX designers use a variety of research methods such as surveys, observations, diary studies, focus groups, and competitive analyses to develop an understanding of users and what motivates them.
##### Personas, User Scenarios, and Empathy Maps
These are all common results of ethnographic research: personas are examples of potential end users, user scenarios illustrate the times in their lives where they will use the product, and empathy maps illustrate their feelings towards the product while they are using it.
##### Customer Journey Maps
User journey maps are often used to illustrate touch points within a scenario where an end user is interacting with a digital system. Customer journey maps are useful for identifying usability issues across omnichannel experiences.
##### Wireframes
Wireframes are the physical blueprints for screens that make up a product. Shown in low fidelity, wireframes help developers create the basic structure for an application before a UI is implemented. They are also a useful tool to put in front of end users in order to validate assumptions about products before they are built
##### Prototyping
Prototyping is an essential part of UX design because it helps to visualize how users will experience software before it is developed. There are a variety of prototyping tools available, like InVision, Adobe XD, and Principle. Prototypes can be used to test projects with end users as well as being a means for communicating designs to development teams.
##### User Testing
User testing is essential to validating whether or not a user is experiencing an application as designed. Some methods of user testing include A/B testing, eye tracking, heatmaps, and observations and interviews.

#### The Importance of UX Design
UX design attempts to deliver the right solution, in the right way, at the right time, and delight people when they interact with a digital system. It’s important to engage a skilled UX designer in order to understand the user deeply and optimize digital products based on stakeholder and end user goals.
UX designers have a knack for stepping into the shoes of others and empathizing with their circumstances—“walk a mile in the user’s shoes”—which gives them the ability to create value in the relationship between brands and consumers.
At the end of the day, if design is considered an investment in the success of a product, then engaging with a good user experience designer early on is a great way to strengthen that investment for the long term.

#### What is the difference between UX and UI?
The interface is not the solution. UI (user interface) design generally plays an important role in the work of a UX (user experience) designer, but it is not the only part. Think of it this way: UX design is the journey and the UI is the destination.
#### What is the UX process?
The UX design process is the practical application of empathy used to observe, analyze, and evaluate a user's engagement with a digital product. It is a broad field with opportunities to engage in user research, information architecture, content strategy, user testing, prototyping, and more.
#### What is a user experience (UX) designer?
A UX designer employs a user-centric approach to problem-solving. After rigorous analysis of business goals and technical feasibility, they conduct user research and design user experiences that ensure that the right solution is delivered in the right way, at the right time, providing optimum user experiences.
#### What is a heuristic evaluation?
A heuristic evaluation is used to identify a product’s common usability issues so that they can be resolved, consequently improving user satisfaction and raising the chances of a digital product’s overall success. Typically, a usability expert also performs a heuristic analysis to identify usability issues.
#### What is an experience map?
An experience map is a visual representation illustrating a user’s flow within a product or service—their goals, needs, anxieties, expectations—i.e., the experience throughout their interaction with a product. It’s typically laid out on a linear timeline showing touchpoints between the user and the product.
#### What is a user scenario?
A user scenario (or use-case scenario) is often used in product development and describes a small story where the user’s tasks, goals, environmental context and technology used is defined in order to come up with the best solution (features and functionality) for an interaction in a digital product.

**Open-ended questions** encourage people to reflect and reveal what’s important for them. They allow people to freely expand on what is comfortable for them, rather than justifying their thoughts. Open-ended questions tend to explore possibilities, feelings, and the reasons why.
* **Explorative** questions force expansion on new points of view and uncovered areas. Have you thought of…?
* **Affective** questions reveal people’s feelings about something. How do you feel about…?
* **Reflective** questions encourage more elaboration. What do you think causes…?
* **Probing** questions invite a deeper examination. Can you describe how…?
* **Analytical** questions look for the roots of a problem. What are the causes of…?
* **Clarifying** questions help align and avoid misunderstandings. So, you mean that..?

**Closed questions** call for specific answers—usually yes or no—or they force the respondent to select an answer from a given set, or to agree or disagree with a statement. Closed questions tend to focus on facts—what, when, where—and are usually easy to answer. For example: “Where were you born? How many miles do you drive a month?”




### **Features**

#### **Header**
The very first feature you will see are social links. These will link the user to said social sights. They are on the top left of the page and they are only small to essentially be a feature elements. It gives users different ways of connecting with the site’s owners also current users of the site too. The social links are placed on every page in the header and footer again equalling easy access. They are in white to contrast against the black background. The header also contains the title of the site “From Paper to Screen” this takes up a large proportion of the screen and is this positioned in the centre. Then when viewing on a mobile device the text flows better. The menu bar is again featured on every page. They are linked to each individual page for easy navigation. There is a hvr-sweep-to-bottom in a dusky lilac so it adds to the aesthetic of the page.

#### **Footer**
The footer is also featured on every page. There are four pages in total with the Header and Footer being present on each. There is a menu bar in the footer, listing the pages of the website, next to that is a list of the site owners top picks and finally at the bottom right of the page there are the social links just promoting other ways you can follow the site owners. The bootstrap grid method has been utilised on every page just with the layout being slightly different.
Section

#### **Home**
The Homepage of the website. It features some information on what the site is about, profile cards of each of the site owner with links to more in depth information. Then lastly a soundtrack video to add aesthetic to the website. This page only features snippets of information. Just enough to grab attention, focusing on colour schemes and the use of different fonts. This page works as a set up for the rest of the website.

#### **About**
The about page is laid out the same as the home with information about the site then a row of four pictures. Underneath a user will find information on the 3 site owners. How they formed, their top choices and a short bio with their pictures. When a user keeps scrolling down they will find a form to fill out which will email the owners in case of an enquiry. As aforementioned every page includes the Header and the Footer elements.

#### **Top Choices**
This page features three books that are suggested to read, LOTR, Harry Potter and The Hobbit. Each book is laid out in a bootstrap row and col-md-4. They also feature a “Read More/ Read Less” function with an affiliate link to amazon at the bottom of each column. The row underneath is laid out in the same format, instead of displaying books it displays movies/series to watch.

#### **Forum**
The forum page has most of the MongoDB database featured. It follows the CRUD functionality. So you can see the suggested list, create another suggestion, edit the book, and then mark if it has been read or watched or both. Underneath that there is a HTML only form subscribing a user to the newsletter.

#### **Existing Features**

#### **Manual testing**

##### **Header:**
* Go to the "Home" page from a desktop.
* Change the screen size from desktop to mobile to verify that the navigation bar looks good on smaller screen sizes also.
* When checking responsiveness of navbar, verify that there is no overflow causing ugly size changes to menu items.
* Hover over the menu bar to test the hover elements.
* Hover over social links to see the colour change.
* Click on each navigation menu item and verify that it links to the correct page.
* Change screen size to small and verify that menu text is centred.
* Repeat verification of functionality and responsiveness on div tools.

##### **Footer:**
* Hover over each social media icon and confirm colour and size transitions expected.
* Reduce and expand width of window to verify that the footer is responsive and looks good on all device widths.
* Review all functionality and responsiveness on div tools.

##### **Page images:**
* Hover over each image in the content and confirm that the alt title for each appears.
* Reduce and expand width of window to verify that each image behaves and centres the way expected, and that they look good on all device widths.

##### **Page content:**
* Reduce and expand width of window to verify that each line of text behaves the way expected, and that the text arrangement looks good on all device widths.
* Read More/Read Less – ensure each column is centred. 
* Contact form: 
    * Go to the "Contact Us" page
    * Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    * Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    * Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
* Click “Edit” “Read” “Watched” and “Add a Book” to make sure they link to the correct pages.
* Run app.py

### **Deployment**

This project was developed using the Cloud9 IDE, committed to git and pushed to GitHub using the built in function within cloud9. To deploy this page to Heroku from its GitHub repository, the following steps were taken:

#### **Deploying to Production with Git** 
The most common, but also the simplest method: pushing code from a Git repository to a Heroku app. You simply add your Heroku app as a remote to an existing Git repository, then use git push to send your code to Heroku. Heroku then automatically builds your application and creates a new release.
Because this method requires a developer with full access to manually push code to production, it's better suited for pre-production deployments or for projects with small, trusted teams.
##### **Pros:**
* Simple to add to any Git-based workflow
* Supports Git submodules

##### **Cons:**
* Requires access to both the Git repository and Heroku app

#### **GitHub Integration** 
If your repository is hosted on GitHub, you can use GitHub integration to deploy changes directly to Heroku. After linking your repository to a Heroku app, changes that are pushed to your repository are automatically deployed to the app. You can configure automatic deployments for a specific branch, or manually trigger deployments from GitHub. If you use continuous integration (CI), you can even prevent deployments to Heroku until your tests pass. 
GitHub integration is also useful for automating pipelines. For example, when a change is merged into the master branch, you might deploy to a staging environment for testing. Once the change has been validated, you can then promote the app to production.
##### **Pros:** 
* Automatically deploys apps and keeps them up-to-date
* Integrates with pipelines and review apps to create a continuous delivery workflow
* If you use a CI service (such as Heroku CI) to build/test your changes, Heroku can prevent deployment when the result is fail

##### **Cons:** 
* Requires administrator access to the repository, so it’s only useful for repositories you own
* Does not support Git submodules
